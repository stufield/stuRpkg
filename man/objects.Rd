\description{
Below is a listing of all the objects contained in the
"stuRpkg" beginner package. There is a short description of
each object, and perhaps a description of its elements, how they were
derived, and their sources. Authorship of the object is attributed where
it is known.

\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{TreeData}: Data set containing tree characteristic metric data,
that has been blinded
and anonymized from its original source. Used heavily in the \code{R}
tutorial and for general data frame usage (e.g. package testing).
The format is "tibble" data frame containing 20 cases and numerous random variables

\item \code{popdata}: A data set it the data produced by the
projection for the 6 class example used in the EEID R tutorial.
The format is a matrix of the 6-class population projection with classes
as columns and the map/step solutions as the rows

\item \code{Ri_data}: Coefficient Interclass Correlation Data Example
from Sokal & Rohlf (Biometry; 3rd ed.), pages 210-214.
The format is a data frame of data with treatments as
columns and rows as  cases.

\item \code{MC_sims}: A vector containing 1000 Monte-Carlo simulation
estimates of the integral estimate (area under curve) for a
given function. The simulation is time greedy so these
data are saved as an object.
The format is a numeric vector of length = 1000.

\item \code{InfectionByCounty}: Infection data describing the infections
count data of an infectious disease
by geographic position. Includes the following headings: \cr
\itemize{
\item CountyNo
\item CountyNo
\item CountyName
\item State
\item Fips
\item Site
\item Lat
\item Long
\item Population
\item Area
\item Density
\item Infected
}
A "tibble" data frame containing 3082 individual cases/records.

\item \code{test_data}: A quick sample tibble data frame for
running examples and checking data frame functionalities.
See \code{?tibble}.
